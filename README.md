# Reinfo-Cube
The concept used to solve the Rubik's cube here is Q-Learning from Reinforcement learning

1. Q-Learning Iteration:​ 
 ``` Perform Q-learning over specified episodes, updating state-action pairs.​ ```

2. Initialization:​
``` Initialize Q-values and rewards for effective learning setup.​```

3. Exploration vs. Exploitation:​
```Balance exploration and exploitation based on a random policy value.​```

4. Action Selection:​
```Choose the action with the highest Q-value during exploitation.​```

5. Q-Value Update:​
```Update Q-values using the Q-learning formula, incorporating rewards and discounted maximum rewards.```
